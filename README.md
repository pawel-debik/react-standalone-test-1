Trying out a couple of things in this project

1: See how far I can get building something with just a react drop-in
2: Practice BEM
3: Try neuomorphic design
4: Make something for a real user; my 7 year old.
5: Get used to editing in nano on the chromebook
6: Mess stuff up in the occasional git commit when switching between computers and fix the conflicts
